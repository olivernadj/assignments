# About Job Interview Assignments

I use this repository to support hiring process for software engineers, with test materials and personal toughs. I prefer to do the screening test in an open playground,
although I pay attention what can be shared in a public repository.

You may wonder [why waste few hours][whywastefewhours] on assignments if you are not sure about the outcome. The simple answer is you will get a competitive job offer if you probably an A-player.
You can introduce yourself as an A-player by:
  - have a call with corporate HR and with me [30m]
  - finishing the home assignments [10h]
  - have an interview and a pear programming [2h]

I able to keep hire, if I hire the right people only. That is why my goal is not to fulfill open headcount, but make sure you are not a jerk or bozos, but a real team player. 

Working in a team with A and A+ people is easy for those whom find joy in engineering challenges, who can turn off the outside world and flow with the task.  
Working in a team with A and A+ people is hard for those whom demotivates A-players.
