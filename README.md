# About Job Interview Assignments
I use this repository to support hiring process for software engineers, with test materials and personal toughs. I prefer to do the screening test in an open playground,
although I pay attention what can be shared in a public repository.

You may wonder [why waste few hours][whywastefewhours] on assignments if you are not sure about the outcome. The simple answer is you will get a competitive job offer if you probably an A-player.
You can follow the interview process and introduce yourself as an A-player:
1. have a call with corporate recruitment. (30min)
2. have a call with the future line manager (1 hour)
3. (most probably you are here)
4. finishing the home assignments (max 8 hours)
5. have a pear or white paper programming in the Lazada TechHub office. Engineers from Hangzhou, China office will join. Foreigners can join via video conference. (3 hours)
6. a call with Head of Department. (30min)
7. get an offer letter (1 min) ðŸ™‚

I able to keep hire, if I hire the right people only. That is why my goal is not to fulfill open headcount, but make sure you are not a jerk or bozo, but a real team player.

Working in a team with A and A+ people is easy for those whom find joy in engineering challenges, who can turn off the outside world and flow with the task.
Working in a team with A and A+ people is hard for those whom demotivates A-players.
