# Job Interview Assignments for Full Stack, Back-End and Front-End Developer position


## Introduction
The task is to create a Basic Shop web application with 3 pages: Welcome, Product [CRUD][CRUD] and Shopping Cart CRUD.

We have only one task, but with options for Full Stack, Back-End and Front-End.  
A Front-End developer may use localStorage and focus on the user interface, meanwhile a Back-End developer may done with RESTful-API endpoint only. Naturally a Full Stack folk should be able to progress on both side. 

The reason why I combined the task for all stack is because the feature request usually does not care about the affinity of the developers, but the comprehensive product.

As we practice I highly recommend to follow the [MVP][MVP] development technique and push your prototype as soon as it has any working function.

Are you ready?
